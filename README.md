# IRIS-FLOWER-CLASSIFICATION
Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.

Although the Scikit-learn library provides a dataset for iris flower classification with Machine Learning. 
# Iris Flower Classification with Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning project for classifying Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The project uses the well-known Iris dataset, and it demonstrates how to train and evaluate a machine learning model for classification.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is included in this project, and it contains measurements of Iris flowers, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, along with the corresponding species labels. The data is split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally or reproduce the results, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. Install the required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the machine learning model.

## Machine Learning Model

We use a Random Forest classifier in this project, but you can easily experiment with other classifiers available in Scikit-learn.

## Results

After training the model, we provide an evaluation of its performance, including accuracy, a confusion matrix, and a classification report.

## Usage

You can use this project as a starting point for your own classification tasks or as a learning resource for understanding how to work with Scikit-learn for machine learning.
